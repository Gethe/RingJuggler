RingJuggler
===========

This addon will automates the swaping of the [Sculpted Eaglebone Ring](http://legion.wowhead.com/item=131764/sculpted-eaglebone-ring&bonus=1792) to ensure that you have perma water walking whenever in the open world.

It will re-equip your previous ring when you enter an instance (eg. Raid, BG, etc.) and also when logging out.
